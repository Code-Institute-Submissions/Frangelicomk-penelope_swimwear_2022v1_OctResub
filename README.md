+ A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly. 
+ Friends, Colleagues from work and family members were asked to review the site and documentation <br>to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
+ I personally have access in 27" 4K Monitor, a 17" Laptop, Android phone which I constatly used for testing.
+ I have used Chrome Developer Tools as Opera Dev Tools to constantly check the website responsivness.
+ As I dont want more images on the markdown please find the testing screenshots on the testing folder. This can be achieved if you navigate on my github page then go to [penelope_swimwear_2022v1](https://github.com/Frangelicomk/penelope_swimwear_2022v1) project there you will find a folder named assets
if you click on there you will see a subfolder testing. If you right click on that folder you will see the images I have uploaded.
Alternatively you can click [here]() to see the folder on my github straight away.

### Difficulties Encountered & Bugs



## Deployment to Github

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.

```


## Deployment to Heroku

### Heroku

The project was deployed to Heroku following the next steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`.
2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command `echo web: python manage.py > Procfile`.
3. Proceed with git add and git commit the new requirements and Procfile and then git push the project to GitHub.
4. Create a new app on [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) by clicking the "New" button on your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to Europe.
5. From the Heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy", "Deployment method" and "select Github".
6. Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct Github repository.
7. In the Heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
8. Set the following config vars:
DATABASE_URL: 
SECRET_KEY :
9. You will also need to add extra vars for sending emails, Stripe payments, and AWS bucket S3 cloud storage.
10. Click on enable deployment.
11. Wait until you get notified a the bottom of the page that your app is deployed and vie the deployment.


## AWS S3 Bucket Creation

### Creating S3 Bucket 

I have followed Code Institute Video + I read the documentation found in [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html)
When you create and upload your files to your bucket you need to set up the following variables in Heroku.

1. Go to your app_name
2. Click onto settings and the reveal conf vars
3. Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = YOUR_KEY
4. Add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
5. USE_AWS = True "This is because in developement we use static files and media files while when our app lunches we will use the S3 Bucket"
